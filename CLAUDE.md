# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Purpose

This repository creates Excel files with soccer/football practice menus explained through images. The project is documented in Japanese.

## Current State

This is an early-stage project with only planning assets:
- `images/ground.png` - Soccer field image
- `images/person.png` - Person image for diagrams

No build system, tests, or application code exists yet. Implementation will likely involve:
- Python (openpyxl/xlsxwriter) or Node.js (ExcelJS) for Excel generation
- Image manipulation for practice diagrams
